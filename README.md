**Creating the files needed for MPAS-Ocean/Seaice in EarthWorks**
Input files needed by EarthWorks:
  Required:
    Mesh and Input file - this has all the mpas metrics plus initial conditions for the ocean. Can be a restart file.
    ESMF mesh file.
    Graph decomposition file.
  Optional:
    Runoff remapping file - needed to properly couple to runoff models
    Surface salinity forcing file - for OMIP style spin up runs.
    Transect and basin file - defines regions for ocean diatnostics.

Initial conditions if not starting from a restart

Ocean temperature and salinity are provided by the mesh and input file. Velocities are zero. The sea surface height is flat. Ocean files have 100 layers and a maximum depth of 6000m. The nominal ocean layer depths are in file /glade/campaign/univ/ucsu0085/build-mpas-ocean-data/refBottomDepth. 
The model initializes the seaice to be disks of uniform thickness surrounding each pole. This is placed atop the flat ocean.

**Overview of steps to creating these files:**

Start with a global base mesh file - this can be an atmospheric initial condition file or one of the mesh files found at https://mpas-dev.github.io/atmosphere/atmosphere_meshes.html

Create a file with the bathymetry defined on the global base (mpasa) mesh - this will use a 15s bathymetry file that can be found at /glade/campaign/univ/ucsu0085/build-mpas-ocean-data/SRTM15_plus_earth_relief_15s_original.nc. Compile the bathymetry_to_mpasa.f90 file with the netCDF library and run. This will require the global base mesh file as input, and you will need to specify a name for the global base mesh bathymetry file that will be created. The bathymetry output by this program will have negative values where the ocean domain is defined, and zero for land. The program has an example block the user may use as a template for user-specified modifications to the ocean domain - look for '!15km - fill/dredge'.

Create a file defining mesh variables on the ocean domain, and basic initial state variables to start the ocean from rest (except T and S, which will be appended later), and to enable seaice to start as specified from the model namelist - build_culled_file_from_bathy.f90 is built with mpi, hdf5, netcdf, and pnetcdf libraries. It requires as input the global base mesh file, the global base mesh bathymetry file, and will write the ocean domain mesh file which name the user will specify. There is also a template block that allows the user to modify the domain - look for '! 15km adjustment'.

Create an ESMF mesh file for the ocean domain - mpas2esmf.f90 takes as input the ocean mesh file and creates an ocean domain ESMF mesh file specified by the user.

Create an ocean domain graph file for metis decomposition - create_graph.f90 takes as input the ocean mesh file and generates the ocean domain graph file specified by the user. NOTE! the file generated by this program requires further user intervention. The second number in line 1 needs correction (it is a text file). Run gpmetis on it. You will get something like:

	gpmetis <graph_file_name> <number_of_PEs>

	***  I detected an error in your input file  ***

	In the first line of the file, you specified that the graph contained
	84444 edges. However, I only found 84244 edges in the file.
	Please specify the correct number of edges in the first line of the file.

Edit the graph files. Replace the second number of line one with the second value of edges specified in the warning message.
